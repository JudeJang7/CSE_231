    The game is played on a grid where each intersection is a "point" and
    three points in a row is called a "mill". Each player has 9 pieces and
    in Phase 1 the players take turns placing their pieces on the board to 
    make mills. When a mill (or mills) is made one opponent's piece can be 
    removed from play. In Phase 2 play continues by moving pieces to 
    adjacent points. 
    
    The game is ends when a player (the loser) has less than three 
    pieces on the board.
